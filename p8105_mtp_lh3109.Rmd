Data Cleaning

data =
  #import data
  read_excel("data/p8105_mtp_data.xlsx", range = "A9:I1230") %>% 
  #clean variable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    #replace missing value in eop_size_mm with 0
    eop_size_mm = ifelse(is.na(eop_size_mm), 0, eop_size_mm),
    #factor "sex" column
    sex = factor(sex, levels = c("1","0")),
    #factor age group
    age_group = factor(age_group, levels = c("2","3","4","5","6","7","8")),
    #factor EOP size
    eop_size = factor(eop_size, levels = c("0","1","2","3","4","5"))
